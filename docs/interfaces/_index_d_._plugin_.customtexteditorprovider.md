# Interface: CustomTextEditorProvider

Provider for text based custom editors.

Text based custom editors use a [`TextDocument`](#TextDocument) as their data model. This considerably simplifies
implementing a custom editor as it allows VS Code to handle many common operations such as
undo and backup. The provider is responsible for synchronizing text changes between the webview and the `TextDocument`.

Resolve a custom editor for a given text resource.

This is called when a user first opens a resource for a `CustomTextEditorProvider`, or if they reopen an
existing editor using this `CustomTextEditorProvider`.

To resolve a custom editor, the provider must fill in its initial html content and hook up all
the event listeners it is interested it. The provider can also hold onto the `WebviewPanel` to use later,
for example in a command. See [`WebviewPanel`](#WebviewPanel) for additional details.

#### Parameters:

Name | Type | Description |
------ | ------ | ------ |
`document` | [TextDocument](_index_d_._plugin_.textdocument.md) | Document for the resource to resolve. |
`webviewPanel` | [WebviewPanel](_index_d_._plugin_.webviewpanel.md) | Webview to resolve. |
`token` | [CancellationToken](_index_d_._plugin_.cancellationtoken.md) | A cancellation token that indicates the result is no longer needed.  |

**Returns:** [Thenable](_index_d_.thenable.md)\<void> \| void

Thenable indicating that the custom editor has been resolved.
